It measures the manager's contribution to performance due to security selection or market timing. A positive Alpha indicates that the portfolio did better than the benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis, and a negative Alpha indicates the portfolio under-performed the benchmark, given the expectations established by the fund's beta. In mathematical terms, Alpha is the intercept of the linear regression equation of the excess returns over the risk-free asset for the portfolio and the benchmark.",

A completely diversified security will be perfectly correlated with the market, and will have an R-squared of 100%. For example, an R-Squared of 0.75 implies that 75% of the fluctuation in a portfolio's return is explained by the fluctuation in the benchmark. R-Squared is also used as a measure of how reliable, predictable, and valid the alpha and beta are. For simple regression, R-Squared is the square of the correlation coefficient between the portfolio and the benchmark.",
